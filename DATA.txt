Just give me a reason to keep my heart beating
Don't worry, it's safe right here in my arms
As the world falls apart around us
All we can do is hold on, hold on
Take my hand
And bring me back, yeah
I'll risk everything if it's for you
A whisper into the night
Telling me, it's not my time and don't give up
I've never stood up before, this time
But what I can't give up
I won't let go of this hand I hold
So stand up, stand up
Just gotta keep, I wanna wake up, wake up
Just tell me how I can never give up
Crazy moments of glamorous
Just tell me why, baby
They might call me crazy
For saying, "I'll fight until there is no more"
A flash of sorrowful glare is sensory urge
Blinded, I can't see the end
So where do I begin?
Say not a word, I can hear you
The silence between us
Just pretending it's nothing
I'll take this chance and I'll make it mine
Something just can't hide
Make it look like it's decorated
So stand up, stand up
Just gotta keep, I wanna wake up, wake up
Just tell me how I can never give up
Even through sorrow and pain
Sorrow and sadness of glamorous
Just give me a reason to keep my heart beating
Don't worry, it's safe right here in my arms
Crushed, cried, bloomed, scattered, this thoughts are
So blinded, I can't see the end
Look how far we've made it
The pain I can't escape it
We can't end it just like this, right?
No matter how many times, even if I nearly die
Even if it turns to ashes, there's no end
So where do I begin?
I grasped not to lose
If spread my hands, felt like it'd spill
Throwing away the daily inertia of having nothing to lose
I'll make you—
Just tell me why, baby
They might call me crazy (Crazy!)
For saying, "I'll fight until there is no more" (No more!)
A flash of sorrowful glare is sensory urge
Blinded, I can't see the end
Look how far we've made it (Made it!)
The pain I can't escape it (Escape it)
We can't end it just like this, right?
No matter how many times, even if I nearly die
Even if it turns to ashes, there's no end (Yeah!)
It finally begins
[Intro]
We are, we are
We are, we are

[Verse 1]
They think that we're no one
We're nothing, not sorry
They push us
It’s too late, it’s too late
Not going back
They think we are made up
Of all of our failures
They think we are foolish
And that’s how the story goes

[Pre-Chorus]
They stand for nothing
They’re lifeless and cold
Anything they say
Will never break our hearts of gold

[Chorus]
When you’re standing on the edge
So young and hopeless
Got demons in your head
We are, we are
No ground beneath your feet
Not here to hold you
‘Cause we are, we are
The colors in the dark
[Verse 2]
Now covered in madness
But they just can’t hurt us
They tell us we're nothing
Keep walking and let it go

[Pre-Chorus]
They are the weakest
And don’t even know
Anything they say
Will never break our hearts of gold

[Chorus]
When you’re standing on the edge
So young and hopeless
Got demons in your head
We are, we are
No ground beneath your feet
Not here to hold you
‘Cause we are, we are
The colors in the dark

[Bridge]
Never tell yourself
You should be someone else
Stand up tall and say
I’m not afraid, I’m not afraid
So never tell yourself
You should be someone else
Stand up tall and say
I’m not afraid

[Chorus]
When you’re standing on the edge
So young and hopeless
Got demons in your head
We are, we are
No ground beneath your feet
Not here to hold you
‘Cause we are, we are
The colors in the dark

[Verse 1]
I know they don't like me that much
Guess that I don't dress how they want
I just wanna be myself
I can't be someone else
Try to color inside their lines
Try to live a life by design
I just wanna be myself
I can't be someone else, someone else

[Pre-Chorus]
They yell, they preach, I've heard it all before
"Be this, be that", I've heard it before, heard it before

[Chorus]
Big boys don't cry
Shoot low, aim high
Eat up, stay thin
Stand out, fit in
Good girls don't fight
Be you, dress right
White face, tan skin
Stand out, fit in

[Post-Chorus]
Stand out, fit in
Stand out, fit in

[Verse 2]
Lately, it's been too much all day
Words shoot like a cannon at me
I just wanna be myself
I can't be someone else, someone else

[Pre-Chorus]
They yell, they preach, I've heard it all before
"Be this, be that", I've heard it before, heard it before

[Chorus]
Big boys don't cry
Shoot low, aim high
Eat up, stay thin
Stand out, fit in
Good girls don't fight
Be you, dress right
White face, tan skin
Stand out, fit in

[Post-Chorus]
Stand out, fit in
Stand out, fit in
Stand out, fit in
Stand out, fit in

[Verse 1]
So they say that time
Takes away the pain
But I’m still the same
And they say that I
Will find another you
That can’t be true, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, why didn’t I realise?
Why did I tell lies?
Yeah, I wish that I could do it again
Oh, turnin’ back the time
Back when you were mine
All mine

[Chorus]
So this is heartache?
So this is heartache?
All this pain in the chest, my regrets
And things we never said, oh baby
So this is heartache?
So this is heartache?
What me meant, what we said that night
Why did I let you go?
I miss you

[Verse 2]
So they say that I didn’t know what I had in my life until it’s gone
The truth is that I knew you were the life
We never knew it would end

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, baby watching you walk away
Why didn’t I make you stay?
Yeah, I wish that I could do it again
Turnin’ back the time
Back when you were mine
All mine, yeah

[Chorus]
So this is heartache?
So this is heartache?
All this pain in the chest, my regrets
And things we never said, oh baby
So this is heartache?
So this is heartache?
What me meant, what we said that night
Why did I let you go?
I miss you

[Bridge]
It’s so hard to forget
Getting worse as the pain goes by
Yeah, it’s so hard to forget
What do I do in all of this life?
You and all the regret
I tried and hide the pain with nothing
I’ll never be alive with no more you and I
I can’t forget the look in your eyes

[Chorus]
So this is heartache?
So this is heartache?
All this pain in the chest, my regrets
And things we never said, oh baby
So this is heartache?
So this is heartache?
What we meant, what we said that night
Why did I let you go?
I miss you

[Outro]
I miss you
I miss you
I miss you

[Verse 1]
Stuck in the same routine
Living an empty dream
When am I gonna wake up? (Oh, oh, oh, oh)
Thought we had it right
Now it's an endless night
Where is it gonna take us? (Oh, oh, oh, oh)

[Pre-Chorus]
Realizing, everything I love is slowly killing me

[Chorus]
(I know, I know)
We're taking off together
Even though we always crash and burn
Tonight you and I will fall from the sky
Drag me all the way to hell
'Cause I'm never gonna let it go
I'm never gonna let it go

[Verse 2]
Build a broken heart
Watching it fall apart
This is how I like it
Sink your teeth in
Give me what I want
I love the way it hurts

[Pre-Chorus]
Realizing, everything I love is slowly killing me

[Chorus]
(I know, I know)
We're taking off together
Even though we always crash and burn
Tonight you and I will fall from the sky
Drag me all the way to hell
'Cause I'm never gonna let it go

[Post-Chorus]
I know, I know
I'm never gonna let it go
I know, I know
Never gonna let it go
I know, I know
Drag me all the way to hell
'Cause I'm never gonna let it go

[Bridge]
(Oh, oh-ah, yeah)
Don't lie, you know everything you do is killing me
(I know, I know)
We're taking off together
Even though we always crash and burn
Tonight you and I will fall from the sky
Drag me all the way to hell

[Chorus]
We're taking off together
Even though we always crash and burn
Tonight you and I will fall from the sky
Drag me all the way to hell
'Cause I'm never gonna let it go

[Post-Chorus]
I know, I know
I'm never gonna let it go
I know, I know
Never gonna let it go
I know, I know
Drag me all the way to hell
'Cause I'm never gonna let it go

[Verse 1]
Got a fire in my soul
I've lost my faith in this broken system
Got love for my home
But if we cry, is there anyone listening?
We're the forgotten generation
We want an open conversation
Follow me on this road
You know we gotta let go

[Pre-Chorus]
For all of the times that they said it's impossible
They built the hurdles, the walls, and the obstacles
When we're together, you know we're unstoppable now

[Chorus]
I'm not afraid
To tear it down and build it up again (Up again)
It's not our fate
We could be the renegades (Renegades)
I'm here for you, ooh
Are you here for me too?
Let's start again
We could be the renegades (Renegades)

[Post-Chorus]
Woah, oh, woah, oh

[Verse 2]
They've been holdin' us down
They've been tellin' us to change our voices
But we're not part of that crowd
We made our bed and we'll make our own choices
We may be underestimated
But I know one day we will make it
Time to say it out loud
We are young and we're proud

[Pre-Chorus]
For all of the lies and the burden they put on us
All of the times that they told us to—, just because
We gotta fight for our rights and the things we love now

[Chorus]
I'm not afraid
To tear it down and build it up again (Up again)
It's not our fate
We could be the renegades (Renegades)
I'm here for you, ooh
Are you here for me too?
Let's start again
We could be the renegades (Renegades)

[Post-Chorus]
Woah, oh, woah, oh
Woah, oh, woah, oh
We could be the renegades

[Bridge]
Take a deep breath, close your eyes and get ready
Take a deep breath, close your eyes and get ready
Take a deep breath, close your eyes and get ready to fly

[Chorus]
I'm not afraid
To tear it down and build it up again (Up again)
It's not our fate
We could be the renegades (Renegades)
I'm here for you, ooh
Are you here for me too?
Let's start again
We could be the renegades (We could be the renegades)

[Post-Chorus]
Woah, oh, woah, oh
(We could be the, we could be the) We could be the renegades

[Outro]
Woah, oh, woah, oh

[Verse 1]
Switch the light off, welcome to the night
What's the problem, not gonna make it right?
Bite the bullet then pull the trigger, hold tight
(It's a feeling you know)

[Verse 2]
Running on, the lights are up in the sky
Nothing matters when you're in the fight
Hold your fire
Maybe we can make it alright
(You take, take, take, take it for no one)

[Pre-Chorus]
But I don't know what to call it (Call it)
When I know I don't care anymore
In the end we know it's always wrong (No time, no more)

[Chorus]
Cry out, will you tell me now?
So, we say we want change
And never be the same (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Cry out
Oh, I'm burning out
Can't you hear the sound?
(Voices all around)
('Cause we're going down)

[Verse 3]
In the moment, can't move from the start
So close, so hard to fall apart
Only heaven knows how far we are
(I take, take, take, take it for no one)

[Verse 4]
I love this feeling
You're the only one that's really lost
Never gonna get it
Never gonna get it right
(You take, take, take, take it for no one)

[Pre-Chorus]
But I don't know what to call it (Call it)
When I know I don't care anymore
In the end I know we'll all be gone (You and I will be alright)

[Chorus]
Cry out, will you tell me now?
So we say we want change
And never be the same (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Cry out
Oh, I'm burning out
Can't you hear the sound?

[Bridge]
One by one it's taking apart, it's taking apart of me
Can't you hear the voices screaming?
Out loud to me, I feel it
We can be the change we needed
Shout it out now, shout it out now
Can't you hear the voices screaming?
Out loud to me, I feel it
We can be the change we needed
Shout it out now, shout it out now

[Chorus]
Cry out, will you tell me now?
So, we say we want change
And never be the same (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Cry out
Oh, I'm burning out
Can't you hear the sound?
(Voices all around)
Can't you hear the sound?
('Cause we're going down)
(Voices all around)
('Cause we're going down)


[Verse 1]
When we met
The pain stood still, it was us
Then suddenly, it's "where'd you go?"
The system blew, I knew

[Pre-Chorus]
This side of me, I want a little more (Little more)
But inside, it seems I'm just a little boy
Nothing else

[Chorus]
Don't go, it's a mighty long fall
When you thought love was the top (Woah)
Oh, no, it's a wake-up call
When your life went into shock (Woah, woah)
It seems like gravity keeps pulling us back down (Woah)
Don't go, it's a mighty long fall
When you know time is up (Woah, woah; ah-woo)

[Verse 2]
When we said
These lies for love, it was us

[Pre-Chorus]
This side of you, show me a little more
But in timе, I'll see, you're just a little score
So down with it, down wе go

[Chorus]
Don't go, it's a mighty long fall
When you thought love was the top (Woah)
Oh, no, it's a wake-up call
When your life went into shock (Woah, woah)
It seems like gravity keeps pulling us back down (Woah)
Don't go, it's a mighty long fall
When you know time is up, time is up (Woah, woah)

[Interlude]
Woah, oh
Woah, oh
Woah, oh
Woah, oh

[Bridge]
Get up, get up, get up, get up
Time to make amends for what you did
Get up, get up, get up, get up
Running with your demons in your head
Let's shout it out completely
Never really wanna know
Let's shout it out, we're screamin', oh

[Breakdown]
(Oh, oh)
(Oh, oh)

[Chorus]
Don't go, it's a mighty long fall
When you thought love was the top (Woah)
Oh, no, it's a wake-up call
When your life went into shock (Woah, woah)
It seems like gravity keeps pulling us back down (Woah)
Don't go, it's a mighty long fall
When you know time is up (Woah, woah)

[Outro]
Don't go (Oh)
D-D-D-D-Don't go (Oh)
D-D-D-D-Don't go (Oh)
Don't go (Oh)
(Oh, oh, uh)

[Intro]
(Go on and fuck yourself)
(Go on and fuck yourself)
(Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh)
(Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh)

[Verse 1]
Watching outer space I see them shine
Crazy stuff like this it blows my mind (Oh, yeah)
So many times, waking up to the radio
I'm breaking out of the safety of radio
When did I stop searching for miracles?
It's bad enough when nobody helps

[Chorus]
Memory, memory now
You are nothing but a
Memory, memory now
You are burning out
Washed up all the fight in your eyes
Watch and you can see it is mine
Memory, memory now
Go on and fuck yourself

[Verse 2]
All you ever do is scream and shout
No one ever knows what it's about (Oh, yeah)
In your mind going straight from the manual
That's so old, so many years ago
So when did I stop searching for miracles?
It's bad enough when nobody helps

[Chorus]
You're just a memory, memory now
You are nothing but a
Memory, memory now
You are burning out
Washed up all the fight in your eyes
Watch and you can see it is mine
Memory, memory now
Go on and fuck yourself
(Go on and fuck yourself)

[Bridge]
Don't wanna be a has-been
Never gonna happen, not like you
(Go on and fuck yourself)
Don't wanna be a has-been
Never gonna happen, not like you
(Go on and fuck yourself)
Don't wanna be a has-been
Never gonna happen, not like you
(Go on and fuck yourself)
Don't wanna be a has-been
Never gonna happen, not like you
Don't wanna be a has-been
Never gonna happen, not like you

[Chorus]
Memory, memory now
You are nothing but a
Memory, memory now
You are burning out
Washed up all the fight in your eyes
Watch and you can see it is mine
Memory, memory now
Go on and fuck yourself
Go on and fuck yourself

{Intro}
(Any day)
(Woah-oh-oh, woah)
(Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)

[Verse 1: Taka]
Another day, another life
I wanna live it to the fullest
A little work, a lotta play, alright
No time to give, no time to take away
So here we go again with my mistakes

[Pre-Chorus: Taka]
We'll never be as young as we are now

[Chorus: Taka]
You say it's alright, you say it's okay
It's up to you, is that the truth? Tell me
I'm feelin' used with no one to save me
You say it's alright, does that make it o-okay?
What's best for you is less for me
It's my decision

[Interlude]
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)

[Verse 2: Tyler Carter]
I wanna be all that I can be
I want to see the light and to live for me
So I, I'm gonna seize the day
Plеase don't forget my name, oh!

[Pre-Chorus: Tyler Carter]
Wе'll never be as young as we are now

[Chorus: Tyler Carter]
You say it's alright, you say it's okay
It's up to you, is that the truth? Tell me
I'm feelin' used with no one to save me
You say it's alright, does that make it o-okay?
What's best for you is less for me
It's my decision (Woo)

[Break: Tyler Carter]
(Woo)
Oh
(Woo-ooh)

[Bridge: Both, Tyler Carter]
Never, never, never, never again
It's my life, my life, my life, my life to live
Da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da, da, da

[Chorus: Both, Taka]
You say it's alright, you say it's okay
It's up to you, is that the truth? Tell me
I'm feelin' used with no one to save me
You say it's alright, does that make it o-okay?
What's best for them, not listening
It's my decision
You say it's alright, you say it's okay
It's up to you, is that the truth? Tell me (Oh)
I'm feelin' used with no one to save me

[Outro: Tyler Carter]
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
No one to save me

[Verse 1]
It started out as any other story
Then the words begin to fade away
Oh, your smile used to make me smile
But lately I don't feel that way

Try to remember what brought us together
And to forget what's driving us apart
You know we can't wait here forever
Just making time and going nowhere

[Chorus]
Is this our last dance?
Can we take another chance
To be alone together still?

Are we wasting time
Chasing dreams not yours or mine?
Care for you, I always will

[Verse 2]
We can try to keep the love from fading
'Cuz all we have are reasons to be gone
Remember when you used to make me smile?
But lately I don't feel the same

Look up and I see your face
I can see you looking back at me
Every time I think it's getting better
Just making time and going nowhere

[Chorus]
Is this our last dance?
Can we take another chance
To be alone together still?

Are we wasting time
Chasing dreams not yours or mine?
Care for you, I always will
You know I always will

[Bridge]
But there's no looking back
And no more need to cry
No more need to cry
No more need to cry

[Chorus]
Is this all we have?
Should we walk away at last
To be along together still?

Are we wasting time
Chasing dreams not yours or mine?
Care for you, I always will
You know I always will

I am still broken in two parts
There is my mind there is my heart
Nowhere for me to run and hide

You only live to serve yourself
Come crawling back when you need help
After you burn there's no one else

You know the way back
You just crash right into me
But it's not so easy now
Oh way back when

Now that I've seen the other you
How do I know which one is true?
How many faces do you have?

Think that you've got me figured out
All of this time without a doubt
Don't even think that you know me

You know the way back
You just crash right into me
But it's not so easy now
Oh way back
When you only had one face
Saving grace now
You know the way back
(You know the way back)

I am still broken in two parts
There is my mind there is my heart
Nowhere for me to run and hide

You know the way back
You just crash right into me
But it's not so easy now
Oh way back
When you only had one face
Saving grace now
You know the way back
(You know the way back)
(Way back)
(Way back)
(You know the way back)

[Chorus]
Save yourself
Love is pain, I know too well
You've never felt waves this strong
Just save yourself
I learn to sink or swim, but you can't even dive right in
Save yourself
If you're drownin' in your doubt
Save yourself

[Verse 1]
I'm caught up in a current, babe
Heartbreak games you won't play
It's obvious you don't need me
That's okay, drift away

[Pre-Chorus]
I will trust my fate, you live your truth
I will get over it
It's obvious you don't need me
That's okay, drift away

[Chorus]
Save yourself
Love is pain, I know too well
You've never felt waves this strong
Just save yourself
I learn to sink or swim, but you can't even dive right in
Save yourself
If you're drownin' in your doubt
Save yourself

[Verse 2]
You're runnin' from a hurricane
I'll set fire to the rain
I wanna be your lifeline, babe
I got tired and you got brave

[Pre-Chorus]
I will trust my fate, you live your truth
I will get over it
It's obvious you don't need me, no
Can you hear me, can you hear me, can you—

[Chorus]
Save yourself
Love is pain, I know too well
You've never felt waves this strong
Just save yourself
I learn to sink or swim, but you can't even dive right in
Save yourself
If you're drownin' in your doubt
Save yourself

[Bridge]
If you're drownin' in your doubt
Just save yourself

[Breakdown]
(If you're drownin' in your doubt)
(Save, save)

[Chorus]
Save yourself
Love is pain, I know too well
You've never felt waves this strong
Just save yourself
I learn to sink or swim, but you can't even dive right in
Save yourself
If you're drownin' in your doubt
Save yourself

Neon lights

[Verse 1]
Woke up in Hell for a day
Your body's on fire, my soul is in flames
Downtown, my city is gray
But I got the shine, it's in my DNA

[Pre-Chorus]
Sing it
Na, na, na-na-na-na-na, na, na-na-na-na-na
Na, na-na-na-na-na
Blinded by the—
Na, na, na-na-na-na-na, na, na-na-na-na-na
Na, na-na-na-na-na
(I'm blinded by the)

[Chorus]
Neon lights
Shinin' bright on the innocent
Shibuya nights
Burnin' brighter than the sun
Neon lights
What a time to be livin' in
Shibuya nights
Live forever till the morning comes
Gettin' it all for free, livin' a strung-out dream
Livin' a fantasy
Neon lights
Shinin' bright on the innocent
Every one of them
Neon lights

[Verse 2]
Wake up, go misbehave
Get the fuck off the couch, turn the streets to a rave
Black out, drink till we fade
Make your daddy ashamed from Tokyo to LA

[Pre-Chorus]
Sing it
Na, na, na-na-na-na-na, na, na-na-na-na-na
Na, na-na-na-na-na
Blinded by the—

Shinin' bright on the innocent
Shibuya nights
Burnin' brighter than the sun
Neon lights
What a time to be livin' in
Shibuya nights
Live forever till the morning comes
Gettin' it all for free, livin' a strung-out dream
Livin' a fantasy
Neon lights
Shinin' bright on the innocent
Every one of them
Neon—

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Neon lights
Shinin' bright on the innocent
Shibuya nights
Burnin' brighter than the sun
Neon lights
What a time to be livin' in
Shibuya nights
Live forever till the morning comes
Gettin' it all for free, livin' a strung-out dream
Livin' a fantasy
Neon lights
Shinin' bright on the innocent
Every one of them
Neon lights

[Pre-Chorus]
Time that you killed
You promised to help me rebuild
You caught me off guard
Sound the alarm

[Chorus]
Said you'd keep me safe, now you're tearin' me down
Am I laid to waste now that you're not around?
Come and leave your mark
Vandalize my heart
Fuck the pain away, my bed is in ruins
Need you in my veins, don't know how you do it
Come and leave your mark
Vandalize my heart

[Verse 2]
Did we make a work of art just so you could deface it?
Did you let it fall apart just so you could rеplace it?
Tag your name on the sidе of a burning bridge
Watch it fade when the smoke rolls in (Rolls in)

[Pre-Chorus]
Time that you killed
You promised to help me rebuild
Feels like you planned it (Planned it, planned it)
Took us for granted, oh

[Chorus]
Said you'd keep me safe, now you're tearin' me down
Am I laid to waste now that you're not around?
Come and leave your mark
Vandalize my heart
Fuck the pain away, my bed is in ruins
Need you in my veins, don't know how you do it
Come and leave your mark (Come and leave your mark)
Vandalize my heart

[Bridge]
Oh, you're fucking crazy, hate me
Love you breakin' bottles on the pavement
Just to watch them crash

[Chorus]
Said you'd keep me safe, now you're tearin' me down
Am I laid to waste now that you're not around?
Come and leave your mark
Vandalize my heart
Fuck the pain away, my bed is in ruins
Need you in my veins, don't know how you do it
Come and leave your mark (Come and leave your mark)
Vandalize my heart

[Outro]
Said you'd keep me safe, now you're tearin' me down
Am I laid to waste now that you're not around?
Come and leave your mark (Come and leave your mark)
Vandalize my heart

[Intro]
(Go, oh, go)
Why'd you let me let you go?

[Verse 1]
Bullets in the dark
Shootin' through my hesitating heart
We were never gonna go far
'Cause I'm no good at loving someone as good as you
Look what I put you through
I know I can't undo this
I'm black and blue to tell the truth

[Chorus]
It's breakin' me, I'm not just losin' you
I'm losin' what you saw in me
Why'd you let me let you go?
I can't breathe without you here
I wish you'd never watch me leave
Why'd you let me let you

[Drop]
Go, oh, go
Why'd you let me let you go?

[Verse 2]
Wish you made me stay
Wish you didn't let me run away
Guess you knew that I would never change
'Cause I'm no good at lying to someone as good as you
Look what I put you through
I know I can't undo this
I'm black and blue to tell the truth

[Chorus]
It's breaking me, I'm not just losin' you
I'm losin' what you saw in me
Why'd you let me let you go?
I can't breathe without you here
I wish you'd never watch me leave
Why'd you let me let you

[Drop]
Go, oh, go
Why'd you let me let you go?

[Bridge]
I tried, I tried to love you
I swear I tried
But how can I love you if you're not here?
I tried, I tried to love you
I swear I tried
I tried, I tried to love

[Chorus]
It's breakin' me, I'm not just losin' you
I'm losin' what you saw in me
Why'd you let me let you go?
I can't breathe without you here
I wish you'd never watch me leave
Why'd you let me let you

[Drop]
Go, oh, go
Why'd you let me let you go?
Go, oh, go
Why'd you let me let you go?

[Outro]
(Go)

[Verse 1]
What would you say
If the whole world could hear it?
What would you do
If you knew they would believe it?
I need something real
And we don't care how you feel
I don’t wanna give up, we will never give up

[Chorus]
We got black mascara runnin'
We want change, but it ain't comin’
Hanging by a thread
So close to the edge
We wanna beat that generation
But we can't live up to their expectations
Hanging by a thread
So close to the edge

[Refrain]
Livin' in a mad world
We're livin' in a mad world
Livin' in a mad—

[Verse 2]
I cannot change
I'm proud of who I am
And this is how I stay
Don't care if you understand it
I need something real
And we don’t care how you feel
I don’t wanna give up, we will never give up

[Chorus]
We got black mascara runnin'
We want change, but it ain’t comin'
Hanging by a thread
So close to the edge
We wanna beat that generation
But we can't live up to their expectations
Hanging by a thread
So close to the edge

[Bridge]
Livin' in a mad world
We’re livin' in a mad world
We're livin' in a mad world
We're livin' in a mad world
We're livin' in a mad world

[Chorus]
We got black mascara runnin'
We want change, but it ain't comin'
Hanging by a thread
So close to the edge
We wanna beat that generation
But we can't live up to their expectations
Hanging by a thread
So close to the edge

[Outro]
What would you say
If the whole world could hear it?
What would you do
If you knew they would believe it?

[Verse 1]
It's been a ride, fighting through life
Hard to come by some kindness
Tryin' to hide all that's inside
Makin' walls of your silence
And I know there's something goin' on
Though you don't ever let me in
I'd give you all my soul just for you to know

[Chorus]
Your tears are mine
And it's a new world tonight
Say my name and I will fly over to you
Gunning for time
I promise you that it will be alright
Just please hold on

[Verse 2]
I'd like to love you true
With all of your scars
Wish I could care for a little
Piece of your heart
If you'd like to tell me how your story began?
I'm sittin' right here waitin'
And no, you'rе not alone anymore

[Chorus]
Your tears arе mine
And it's a new world tonight
Say my name and I will fly over to you
Gunning for time
I promise you that it will be alright
Just please hold on

[Bridge]
I'll be right here and there's nothin' to hide
Everyone needs understandin' sometimes
You're beautiful even when you feel broken
I'm right by you
We'll make it through
I'll stay with you till the dark fades

[Chorus]
Your tears are mine
It's a new world tonight
Say my name and I will fly over to you
Gunning for time
I promise you that I'll be by your side
Through the fight
Everything's gonna be fine
Just please hold on tight
